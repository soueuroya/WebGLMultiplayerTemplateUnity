UNITY WEBGL MULTIPLAYER ROOMS TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION

The most important script is the MultiplayerManager.cs which handles receiving and sending sockets to the server.

The server listens for all players and sends a message to the client. Then the client calls the C# script in the game with the necessary data.

This code prioritizes performance and game smoothness by only sending sockets on velocity change and preserving speed unless it detects changes.

This code also optimizes external calls by caching frequently used variables such as Transform and Rigidbody.
